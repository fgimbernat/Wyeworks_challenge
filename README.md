To run the service "Album" you should run the command "Album.new" and you will start to see the creations of the lists on Trello: https://trello.com/b/GDWYKn1j/albums.

I previously created the board called "Albums" instead of create a new one each time the service run, to save some development time, but it could be change to do that.

I know that the implementation of the solution wasn't on the scope of the challenge, but I thought it could be a good way to show my skills with docker and aplication building.

I also tried to use the Spotify API to get the cover of each album, but unfortunately it requires to know the id of each album and I don't have them
